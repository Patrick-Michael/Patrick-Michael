## About Me  

Iâ€™m a Global Public Health MSc student at TH Deggendorf (ECRI) with a background in dentistry and a growing passion for data-driven healthcare.  

My work bridges health sciences and technology; from building interactive visualization tools in R to developing clinical decision support systems in Python.  
Iâ€™m especially interested in how digital health technologies can improve transparency, clinical decision support, and equitable access to care. 

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my skills in data management, machine learning, and health informatics to prepare for a career in data-driven public health.
